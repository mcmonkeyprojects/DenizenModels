# @denizen-build REL-1793
# @script-version 2.1
#
# This takes BlockBench "BBModel" files, converts them to a client-ready resource pack and Denizen internal data,
# then is able to display them in minecraft and even animate them, by spawning and moving item display entities with resource pack items.
#
# Installation:
# 1: Edit your "plugins/Denizen/config.yml", find "File:", and "Allow read" and "Allow write" inside, and set them both to "true", then use "/ex reload config"
# 2: Copy the "scripts/dmodels" folder to your "plugins/Denizen/scripts" and "/ex reload"
# 2.5: NOTE: If you do not use the plugin Citizens, you can exclude the "dmodels_citizens" file.
# 3: Note that you must know the basics of operating resource packs - the pack content will be generated for you, but you must know how to install a pack on your client and/or distribute it to players as appropriate
# 4: Take a look at the config settings in the bottom of this file in case you want to change any of them.
#
# Usage:
# 1: Create a model using blockbench - https://www.blockbench.net/
# 1.1 Create as a 'Generic Model'
# 1.2 Make basically anything you want
# 1.3 Animate freely, make sure the animation names are clear
# 2: Save the ".bbmodel" file into "plugins/Denizen/data/dmodels"
# 3: Load the model. For now, just do a command like "/ex run dmodels_load_bbmodel def:GOAT" but replace "GOAT" with the name of your model
#    This will output a resource pack to "plugins/Denizen/data/dmodels/res_pack/"
# 4: Load the resource pack on your client (or include it in your server's automatic resource pack)
# 5: Spawn your model and control it using the Denizen scripting API documented below

# Commands:
#   /[Command]                     - [Permission]           - [Description]
#   /dmodels                       - "dmodels.help"         - Root command entry.
#   /dmodels help                  - "dmodels.help"         - Shows help information about the dModels command.
#   /dmodels load [path]           - "dmodels.load"         - Loads a single model based on model file name input.
#   /dmodels loadall               - "dmodels.loadall"      - Loads all models in the models folder.
#   /dmodels unload [model]        - "dmodels.unload"       - Unloads a single model from memory based on model name input.
######                                                      - This will not properly remove any spawned instances of that model, which may now be glitched as a result.
######                                                      - This also does not remove any data from the resource pack currently.
#   /dmodels unloadall             - "dmodels.unloadall"    - Unloads any/all DModels data from memory.
#   /dmodels spawn [model]         - "dmodels.spawn"        - Spawns a static instance of a model at your location.
#   /dmodels remove                - "dmodels.remove"       - Removes whichever real-spawned model is closest to your location.
#   /dmodels animate [animation]   - "dmodels.animate"      - Causes your nearest real-spawned model to play the specified animation.
#   /dmodels stopanimate           - "dmodels.stopanimate"  - Causes your nearest real-spawned model to stop animating.
#   /dmodels npcmodel [model]      - "dmodels.npcmodel"     - sets an NPC to render as a given model (must be loaded). Use 'none' to remove the model.
#   /dmodels rotate [angles]       - "dmodels.rotate"       - Sets the rotation of the nearest real-spawned model to the given euler angles. Use '0,0,0' for default.
#   /dmodels scale [scale]         - "dmodels.scale"        - Sets the scale-multiplier of the nearest real-spawned model set to the given value. Use '1,1,1' for default.
#   /dmodels color [color]         - "dmodels.color"        - Sets the color of the nearest real-spawned model to the given color. Use 'white' for default.
#   /dmodels viewrange [range]     - "dmoddels.viewrange"   - Sets the view-range of the nearest real-spawned model to the given range (in blocks).
#

#
# API usage examples:
# # First load a model (in advance, not every time - you can use '/ex' to do this once after adding or modifying the .bbmodel file)
# - ~run dmodels_load_bbmodel def.model_name:goat
# # Then you can spawn it
# - run dmodels_spawn_model def.model_name:goat def.location:<player.location> save:spawned
# - define root <entry[spawned].created_queue.determination.first>
# # To move the whole model
# - teleport <[root]> <player.location>
# - run dmodels_reset_model_position def.root_entity:<[root]>
# # To start an automatic animation
# - run dmodels_animate def.root_entity:<[root]> def.animation:idle
# # To end an automatic animation
# - run dmodels_end_animation def.root_entity:<[root]>
# # To move the entity to a single frame of an animation (timespot is a decimal number of seconds from the start of the animation)
# - run dmodels_move_to_frame def.root_entity:<[root]> def.animation:idle def.timespot:0.5
# # To remove a model
# - run dmodels_delete def.root_entity:<[root]>
# # To rotate a model
# - run dmodels_set_rotation def.root_entity:<[root]> def.quaternion:identity
# # To scale a model
# - run dmodels_set_scale def.root_entity:<[root]> def.scale:1,1,1
# # To set the color of a model
# - run dmodels_set_color def.root_entity:<[root]> def.color:red

# API details:
#     Runnable Tasks: (Specific documentation on the tasks themselves, visible automatically in the Denizen extension for VS Code when you run them)
#         Loading: dmodels_load_bbmodel, dmodels_multi_load
#         Spawning: dmodels_spawn_model, dmodels_delete
#         Configuring: dmodels_reset_model_position, dmodels_set_yaw, dmodels_set_rotation, dmodels_set_scale, dmodels_set_color, dmodels_set_view_range
#         Animation related: dmodels_end_animation, dmodels_animate, dmodels_attach_to
#         Animation (internal): dmodels_move_to_frame
#     Flags:
#         Every entity spawned by DModels has the flag 'dmodel_root', that refers up to the root entity.
#         The root entity has the following flags:
#             'dmodel_model_id': the name of the model used.
#             'dmodel_parts': a list of all part entities spawned.
#             'dmodel_global_rotation' the rotation of the entire model - this also affects the rotation while the model is animating.
#             'dmodel_global_scale' the scale of the entire model.
#             'dmodel_view_range' the view range of the model.
#             'dmodel_color' the color of the model.
#             'dmodel_anim_part.<ID_HERE>': a mapping of outline IDs to the part entity spawned for them.
#             'dmodels_animation_id': only if the model is animating automatically, contains the animation ID.
#             'dmodels_anim_time': only if the model is animating automatically, contains the progress through the current animation as a number representing time.
#             'dmodels_attached_to': the entity this model is attached to, if any.
#             'dmodels_temp_alt_anim': if set to a truthy value, will tell the model to not play any auto-animations (so other scripts can indicate they need to override the default)
#        Additional flags are present on both the root and on parts, but are not considered API - use at your own risk.
#
# #########
#
# Core Animations:
# Some systems within DModels look for certain core animations to exist, and will use them when relevant.
# For example, the with the 'dmodels_attach_to' task, with the 'auto_animate' flag enabled (or the 'npcmodel' command which enables it by default), will apply animations to match the attached entity.
# List:
#     'idle': default/no activity idle animation.
#     'crouching_idle': default/no activity idle animation, while crouching (sneaking).
#     'running': the animation for moving at normal speed.
#     'sprinting': the animation for moving very fast.
#     'jump': the animation for jumping in place.
