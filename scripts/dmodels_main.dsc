# @script-version 1.7
#
# This takes BlockBench "BBModel" files, converts them to a client-ready resource pack and Denizen internal data,
# then is able to display them in minecraft and even animate them, by spawning and moving invisible armor stands with resource pack items on their heads.
#
# Installation:
# 1: Edit your "plugins/Denizen/config.yml", find "File:", and "Allow read" and "Allow write" inside, and set them both to "true", then use "/ex reload config"
# 2: Copy the "scripts/dmodels" folder to your "plugins/Denizen/scripts" and "/ex reload"
# 2.5: NOTE: If you do not use the plugin Citizens, you can exclude the "dmodels_citizens" file.
# 3: Note that you must know the basics of operating resource packs - the pack content will be generated for you, but you must know how to install a pack on your client and/or distribute it to players as appropriate
# 4: Take a look at the config settings in the bottom of this file in case you want to change any of them.
#
# Usage:
# 1: Create a model using blockbench - https://www.blockbench.net/
# 1.1 Create as a 'Generic Model'
# 1.2 Make basically anything you want
# 1.3 Note that there is a scale limit, of roughly 73 blockbench units (about 4 minecraft block-widths),
#     meaning you cannot have a section of block more than 36 blockbench units from its pivot point.
#     If you need a larger object, add more Outliner groups with pivots moved over.
# 1.4 Make sure pivot points are as correct as possible to minimize glitchiness from animations
#     (for example, if you have a bone pivot point in the center of a block, but the block's own pivot point is left at default 0,0,0, this can lead to the armor stand having to move and rotate at the same time, and lose sync when doing so)
# 1.5 Animate freely, make sure the animation names are clear
# 2: Save the ".bbmodel" file into "plugins/Denizen/data/dmodels"
# 3: Load the model. For now, just do a command like "/ex run dmodels_load_bbmodel def:GOAT" but replace "GOAT" with the name of your model
#    This will output a resource pack to "plugins/Denizen/data/dmodels/res_pack/"
# 4: Load the resource pack on your client (or include it in your server's automatic resource pack)
# 5: Spawn your model and control it using the Denizen scripting API documented below

# Commands:
#   /[Command]                     - [Permission]           - [Description]
#   /dmodels                       - "dmodels.help"         - Root command entry
#   /dmodels help                  - "dmodels.help"         - Shows help information about the dModels command
#   /dmodels load [path]           - "dmodels.load"         - Loads a single model based on model file name input
#   /dmodels loadall               - "dmodels.loadall"      - Loads all models in the models folder
#   /dmodels unload [model]        - "dmodels.unload"       - Unloads a single model from memory based on model name input.
######                                                      - This will not properly remove any spawned instances of that model, which may now be glitched as a result.
######                                                      - This also does not remove any data from the resource pack currently.
#   /dmodels unloadall             - "dmodels.unloadall"    - Unloads any/all DModels data from memory
#   /dmodels spawn [model]         - "dmodels.spawn"        - Spawns a static instance of a model at your location
#   /dmodels remove                - "dmodels.remove"       - Removes whichever real-spawned model is closest to your location
#   /dmodels animate [animation]   - "dmodels.animate"      - Causes your nearest real-spawned model to play the specified animation
#   /dmodels stopanimate           - "dmodels.stopanimate"  - Causes your nearest real-spawned model to stop animating
#   /dmodels npcmodel [model]      - "dmodels.npcmodel"     - sets an NPC to render as a given model (must be loaded). Use 'none' to remove the model.
#   /dmodels rotate [0,0,0]        - "dmodels.rotate"       - Rotates the entire model to the set euler angles.
#   /dmodels scale [1,1,1]         - "dmodels.scale"        - Scales the entire model to the set scale.
#   /dmodels color [255,255,255]   - "dmodels.color"        - Sets the color of the model to the set color.
#

#
# API usage examples:
# # First load a model (in advance, not every time - you can use '/ex' to do this once after adding or modifying the .bbmodel file)

# # Then you can spawn it
# - run dmodels_spawn_model def.model_name:goat def.location:<player.location> save:spawned

# API details:
#     Runnable Tasks:
#         dmodels_load_bbmodel
#             Usage: Loads a model from source ".bbmodel" file by name into server data (flags). Also builds the resource pack entries for it.
#                    Should be called well in advance, when the model is added or changed. Does not need to be re-called until the model is changed again.

#         dmodels_multi_load
#             Usage: Loads multiple models simultaneously, and ends the ~wait only after all models are loaded. This is faster than doing individual 'load' calls in a loop and waiting for each.

#                 auto_animate: (OPTIONAL) set to 'true' to indicate the model should automatically apply animations based on the entity it's attached to. See 'core animations' list below.
#     Flags:
#         Every entity spawned by DModels has the flag 'dmodel_root', that refers up to the root entity.
#         The root entity has the following flags:
#             'dmodel_model_id': the name of the model used.
#             'dmodel_parts': a list of all part entities spawned.
#             'dmodel_anim_part.<ID_HERE>': a mapping of outline IDs to the part entity spawned for them.
#             'dmodels_animation_id': only if the model is animating automatically, contains the animation ID.
#             'dmodels_anim_time': only if the model is animating automatically, contains the progress through the current animation as a number representing time.
#             'dmodels_global_rotation' the rotation of the entire model this also affects the rotation while the model is animating.
#             'dmodels_global_scale' the scale of the entire model.
#             'dmodels_view_range' the view range of the model.
#             'dmodels_color' the color of the model.
#             'dmodels_can_teleport' determines if the root and parts of the model can teleport or not this should be used for non-moveable animated models.
#             'dmodels_attached_to': the entity this model is attached to, if any.
#             'dmodels_temp_alt_anim': if set to a truthy value, will tell the model to not play any auto-animations (so other scripts can indicate they need to override the default)
#         Parts of the model have the following flags:
#             'dmodel_def_part_id': the name of the part.
#             'dmodel_def_can_rotate' if the part can rotate or not while playing animations.
#             'dmodel_def_can_scale' if the part can scale or not while playing animations.
#             'dmodel_def_pose' the default pose of the part after spawning
#             'dmodel_def_offset' the relative offset of the part from the root entity's position
#             'dmodel_root' returns the root entity of the part
#
# #########
#
# Core Animations:
# Some systems within DModels look for certain core animations to exist, and will use them when relevant.
# For example, the with the 'dmodels_attach_to' task, with the 'auto_animate' flag enabled (or the 'npcmodel' command which enables it by default), will apply animations to match the attached entity.
# List:
#     'idle': default/no activity idle animation.
#     'crouching_idle': default/no activity idle animation, while crouching (sneaking).
#     'running': the animation for moving at normal speed.
#     'sprinting': the animation for moving very fast.
#     'jump': the animation for jumping in place.
